# CyclingRoutes
A (sorted) collection of cycling routes. This has a focus on road and gravel routes around the Karlsruhe area.
There is no guarantee that these routes are actually up to date and still working, this is just a collection of ideas.

- [Gravel bike routes around Karlsruhe](collections/gravel-ka.md)
- [Road bike routes around Karlsruhe](collections/road-ka.md)
- [Gravel bike routes anywhere else](collections/gravel-misc.md)
- [Road bike routes anywhere else](collections/road-misc.md)

The formatting here is still very rudimentary, there are no preview images (not sure how to get them without license issues). The plan is to have at least a link to some routing website (mostly komoot?), a gpx file and minimal information (route length and elevation).
